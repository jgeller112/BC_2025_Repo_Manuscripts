# Introduction

## Packages

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(palmerpenguins) # penguins
library(quarto) # qmd 
library(rmarkdown) # markdown
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(papaja) # apa writing template
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo:  true
#| 
install.packages('tinytex') # for use with pdf 
tinytex::install_tinytex()
# to uninstall TinyTeX, run tinytex::uninstall_tinytex() 
```

-   You should also have Zotero installed along with Better BibTeX (nice, but not necessary)

# The Problem

## Word

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Inside

## Word issues

::: incremental
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A .docx file is a compressed folder with lots of files
    -   Your text is buried in with a lot of formatting information

<!-- -->

-   Not reproducible
    -   Code is divorced from writing
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Difficult to maintain
    -   Errors!
-   What do I share?
    -   Lack of transparency
:::
:::
:::

## What do we want?

-   Combine narrative with code

-   Automatically generate figures and tables

-   Automatically render results in text

-   Format the content into a scientific paper (including citations!)

-   Something that looks pretty!

-   Rinse & repeat

## Hello Quarto!

::: columns

-   Next generation publishing system.
-   Unify and extends the R Markdown ecosystem.
-   **Develop** and **Switch** formats without hassle.

## What is a Quarto?

## How Quarto Works

Quarto handles literate programming by using a series of programs:

![How Quarto Works [(Source)](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png)](assets/quarto-images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png)

-   **`knitr`** executes all code chunks and creates a new markdown (`.md`) file
-   **`pandoc`** takes the markdown file generated and converts it to the desired format.
-   **Render** inside of RStudio handles the interaction.

## Source vs. Visual Mode

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
![Source Editing Mode](assets/quarto-images/rstudio-qmd-source-mode.png){fig-alt="Figure showing what a Quarto document looks like in Source Editing Mode."}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![Visual Editing Mode](assets/quarto-images/rstudio-qmd-visual-mode.png){fig-alt="Figure showing what a Quarto document looks like in Visual Editing Mode."}
:::

::: footer
Visual Mode represents a **What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor**. This mode is similar to Word.

## Advantages

**(1) Eliminate human error in copying and pasting results**

## Advantages

## In the Wild: Data Science Gone Wrong

-   [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) by Adam Marcus, Ivan Oransky, and Alison McCook Monitors for authors retracting their paper from a journal.

-   One such case of a paper being retracted due to an Excel error was the [Growth in a Time of Debt](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15639) by Reinhart & Rogoff.

    -   The error was found by graduate student Thomas Herndon and co-authors Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin.
    -   They published a [critique](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/526-does-high-public-debt-consistently-stifle-economic-growth-a-critique-of-reinhart-and-rogo-ff) highlighting the error.
    -   Herndon appeared on the [Colbert Report](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/kbgnf0/the-colbert-report-austerity-s-spreadsheet-error---thomas-herndon) to discuss their findings

## Advantages

**(2) Easy revisions and specification of desired figures and tables**

*When revisions are requested, one might have to tweak tables and figures by hand constantly, leading to a major incentive never to rerun analyses because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustrating all the numbers and figures in a paper.*

## Advantages

**(3) Promote computational reproducibility**

-   Easy verification and replication of research findings

-   While programming environments may seem counter-intuitive for writing papers, they ultimately prevent mistakes and save time.

# Let's Get Started!

## Getting started

-   Approach 1: Start from scratch (now)

    -   Creating a Quarto manuscript

        -   RStudio: New Project \> New Directory \> Quarto Manuscript

-   ::: callout-note
    Always start a new project folder!
    :::

-   Approach 2: Start with a sample template (later)

# Overview of a Quarto Document

## Create a Quarto Document

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
In the top left, click the White Plus and select "Quarto Document..."

![Creating a new Quarto Document](assets/quarto-images/rstudio-qmd-plus-document-menu.png){width="175" fig-alt="Drop down menu containing Quarto Document creation button"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
In the new prompt, enter a title, author name, and press "Create"

![New Document Options](assets/quarto-images/rstudio-qmd-new-document-prompt.png){fig-alt="New quarto document wizard allowing a title and author information to be set."}

## Getting started

-   Go to the `Getting Started` section of website and complete each part

```{r}
#| echo: false

## **Metadata & Header (YAML)**

``` yaml
---
title: My Reproducible Manuscript
authors:
  - name: Norah Jones
    affiliation: The University
    roles: writing
    corresponding: true
bibliography: references.bib
format: html
---
```

-   Wait... what's the YAML acronym?

    -   Originally: "Yet Another Markup Language"

    -   Later: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

-   Set global manuscript options with key-value pairs

## **Code**

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
1 + 1
```

## **Text**

``` markdown
Section

This is a simple placeholder for the manuscript's main document [@knuth84].
```
